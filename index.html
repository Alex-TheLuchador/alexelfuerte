                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p id="about-text">I was born on February 3, 2000 in The Woodlands, Texas. Some celebrities who have
                    birthdays on February 3 include: Sean Kingston, Daddy Yankee, Andre Ellington, and Isla Fisher.
                    I grew up just a few minutes south of The Woodlands in Spring, Texas. I attended
                    Klein Collins High School and played many sports throughout my school years. 
                    I played baseball in elementary school, track and football in middle school,
                    and kept going with track and cross country in high school. I also wrestled for a bit and played some
                    football in high school. Nowadays I like to train in wrestling/grappling sports, or lift weights.
                    Another favorite hobby of mine is reading comics. I have been a massive fan of superheroes and comics
                    for as long as I can remember, and my favorite superhero is the Silver Surfer, but a close second is
                    Batman, followed by Daredevil. Realizing I preferred Marvel over DC was possibly the most eye-opening
                    experience I have ever had (just kidding).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My love for technology started in early high school when I found out about the "Inspect Element" tool
                    and realized I could make webpages say funny things or look different if I knew what to edit. That got
                    me started with HTML, CSS and Javascript, and eventually I took a Computer Science class in high school
                    and learned Java, which I loved (a love that did not last). In February of 2019, I got my first job in IT,
                    which was a help desk role. I have learned <em>so much</em> since starting here, and one of the things I
                    have learned is that I can never learn enough. Starting each day knowing that I can improve and be better
                    is so exciting, and I always look for a way to improve my skillset. I am currently digging deep into
                    cloud technologies, and I can't wait to see how much there is to the world of cloud computing.
